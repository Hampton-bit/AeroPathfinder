This project integrates Dijkstra's algorithm into a Flight Management System (FMS) to optimize route planning, aiming for a 20% reduction in flight durations and a 15% decrease in fuel consumption. It enhances operational efficiency, while providing an educational tool for Data Structures and Algorithms.
